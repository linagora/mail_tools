Relationship between generated files
------------------------------------

* Each appointment in the calendar generates a file named: <profile_name>.csv.item.<item_number>
* For each item generated, a file with all the item recipients is linked: <profile_name>.csv.itemrecipients.<item_number>

* If the event is a recurring one, the event is linked with its recurrences through the <profile_name>.csv.recurrence.<recurrence_number>.<item_number> file.
* Each recurrence may have exceptions. In this case, a <profile_name>.csv.exception.<exception_number>.<recurrence_number>.<item_number> file is generated.
* If the exception is a move, the moved occurence is written in <profile_name>.csv.appointement.<exception_number>.<recurrence_number>.<item_number> file.

Finally, the file hierarchy is:
	<profile_name>.csv.itemrecipients.<item_number>
	<profile_name>.csv.item.<item_number>
		|
		|___ <profile_name>.csv.recurrence.<recurrence_number>.<item_number>
			|
			|__ <profile_name>.csv.exception.<exception_number>.<recurrence_number>.<item_number> 
				|
				|__ <profile_name>.csv.appointement.<exception_number>.<recurrence_number>.<item_number>
